Task-Specific Architecture Design Instead of using a generic transformer blindly scaled up, we developed AutoArch – an automated system that designs an optimal neural architecture for each task. By tailoring the network layers and attention patterns to the domain, AutoArch often achieves equal or better accuracy with ~10× fewer parameters. This aligns with recent findings that a smaller, precise model can rival a model 10× its size when tuned correctly. In other words, smart design beats brute-force size. AutoArch-generated models are compact yet powerful, focusing compute only where it matters for the task.
Advanced Distillation Techniques We use proprietary knowledge distillation methods to compress the intelligence of large models into smaller ones. In distillation, a large "teacher" model guides a compact "student" model to mimic its behavior. Our approach improves on standard distillation by preserving domain expertise: the student doesn't just learn general language skills, but also the specific medical, legal, or technical knowledge from the teacher's outputs. This yields a specialized mini-model that performs like a targeted version of the original big model. For example, starting with a GPT-4 level model, our distillation process produces a 7B model that retains the relevant capabilities for, say, legal contract analysis – at a fraction of the size. The result is a fleet of small experts, each imbued with the wisdom of a larger model in its specialty.
Knowledge distillation in action: a large teacher model's knowledge is transferred into a smaller student model. The student is trained to reproduce the teacher's outputs (predictions, intermediate representations, etc.), resulting in a compact model that preserves the teacher's skills. This technique lets us shrink massive models while maintaining their prowess on specific tasks.

Efficient Fine-Tuning (LoRA-X) Beyond architecture and distillation, we maximize efficiency in the fine-tuning stage. Our LoRA-X technique is an advanced form of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Instead of updating all 7 billion weights of a model for specialization, LoRA-X inserts small trainable adapter matrices that adjust only about 1% of the model's parameters. Remarkably, this is enough to reach full performance on new tasks. Academic research on LoRA has shown it can achieve no loss in accuracy compared to full fine-tuning despite touching a tiny fraction of the weights. Our LoRA-X builds on this by dynamically selecting which weights to adapt for maximal impact. It means we can fine-tune a model to a new domain overnight on a single GPU, where traditional methods might require updating billions of parameters over days. LoRA-X makes rapid deployment of specialized models practical, even for teams with limited compute.
Real-World Applications
Specialized small models are already revolutionizing AI deployment across industries:

On-Device Medical Diagnosis A healthcare SLM running entirely on mobile devices is helping doctors in the field. For instance, the MedAide system can analyze symptoms and assist in diagnoses on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano at point-of-care, with no cloud required. This enables medical AI in remote or rural areas – a doctor with a rugged tablet can get AI decision support offline, greatly improving care delivery anywhere. Privacy is a bonus: patient data stays on the device.
Real-Time Translation in the Wild Language translation is being transformed by small models at the edge. Instead of calling an online API, new translator apps use on-device SLMs to interpret speech instantly in low-connectivity environments. Imagine a handheld translator or smart earbuds that provide two-way speech translation at a busy market or during disaster response, without needing internet access. By compressing powerful translation abilities into a compact model, we get reliable communication tools that work anytime, anywhere.
Privacy-Preserving AI Assistants Smart assistants and chatbots powered by SLMs are running locally to protect user data. For example, a voice assistant for business uses a specialized 5B model that lives on the company's servers and devices only. It can handle employee queries and tasks without sending sensitive info to an external cloud. This approach addresses compliance and security concerns – all AI processing happens in-house. Thanks to the efficiency of SLMs, such an assistant can run on standard hardware and even laptops, maintaining snappy performance. The result: AI that's as private as it is powerful.
