Production deployment of transformer models requires careful optimization to meet latency and throughput requirements. This article shares our battle-tested techniques.

## The Performance Challenge

Standard transformer implementations are too slow for production:
- Quadratic complexity in sequence length
- Memory bandwidth bottlenecks
- Inefficient GPU utilization

## Our Optimization Stack

### 1. FlashAttention-V3
Our improved version of FlashAttention achieves:
- 3x faster than standard attention
- Linear memory usage
- Support for arbitrary attention patterns

### 2. Dynamic Sparsity
We developed a system that learns sparsity patterns during inference:
- 70% of computations eliminated
- No accuracy loss
- Adapts to input characteristics

### 3. Kernel Fusion
Custom CUDA kernels that fuse multiple operations:
- 40% reduction in memory transfers
- 2x improvement in throughput
- Optimized for modern GPU architectures

## Deployment Best Practices

- Continuous profiling in production
- A/B testing for optimization changes
- Automated performance regression detection
- Multi-level caching strategies

## Results

- 10x improvement in inference speed
- 5x reduction in infrastructure costs
- Enabled real-time applications previously impossible
