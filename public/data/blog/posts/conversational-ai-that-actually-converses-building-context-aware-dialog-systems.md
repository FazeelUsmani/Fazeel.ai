True conversational AI requires more than just language understandingâ€”it needs memory, context awareness, and the ability to maintain coherent dialog over extended interactions.

## The Context Problem

Most chatbots fail because they:
- Forget previous messages
- Lack understanding of implicit context
- Cannot maintain conversation goals
- Struggle with ambiguity and reference resolution

## Our Solution: Hierarchical Context Management

### Three-Level Memory System
1. **Working Memory**: Last 5-10 turns
2. **Episode Memory**: Current conversation session
3. **Long-term Memory**: User history and preferences

### Dynamic Context Window
- Automatically adjusts based on conversation complexity
- Prioritizes relevant information
- Manages token budget efficiently

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Coreference Resolution
Our neural coreference system achieves 94% accuracy in pronoun resolution.

### 2. Intent Persistence
Tracks user goals across multiple turns, even through topic changes.

### 3. Emotion and Tone Modeling
Adapts responses based on detected user emotion and conversation tone.

## Case Study: Customer Support Bot

- 85% issue resolution without human intervention
- 4.8/5 user satisfaction rating
- Average conversation length: 12 turns
- Handles context switches seamlessly

## Future Directions

We're working on:
- Multi-modal context (voice, video)
- Cross-session learning
- Personalization at scale
