RAG systems combine the best of retrieval and generation, but building them at scale requires solving numerous technical challenges.

## Why RAG?

- Reduces hallucination by 90%
- Always up-to-date information
- Explainable AI with source attribution
- No need for constant retraining

## Our RAG Architecture

### 1. Intelligent Document Processing
- Multi-format support (PDF, Word, Excel, HTML)
- Table and figure extraction
- Hierarchical chunking with overlap

### 2. Advanced Retrieval
- Hybrid search: dense + sparse + graph
- Re-ranking with cross-encoders
- Query expansion and reformulation

### 3. Context-Aware Generation
- Dynamic context window management
- Source attribution and confidence scoring
- Factual consistency checking

## Scaling Challenges

### Vector Database Optimization
- Custom HNSW implementation
- Distributed index with 1B+ vectors
- Sub-10ms query latency

### Real-time Updates
- Incremental indexing
- Version control for documents
- Consistency across replicas

## Results

- 10TB document corpus
- 50ms end-to-end latency
- 96% factual accuracy
- 100K+ queries per second

## Lessons Learned

- Retrieval quality matters more than model size
- Hybrid approaches outperform pure dense retrieval
- User feedback loops are crucial for improvement
