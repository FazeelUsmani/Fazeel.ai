2. **Episode Memory**: Current conversation session
3. **Long-term Memory**: User history and preferences

### Dynamic Context Window
- Automatically adjusts based on conversation complexity
- Prioritizes relevant information
- Manages token budget efficiently

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Coreference Resolution
Our neural coreference system achieves 94% accuracy in pronoun resolution.

### 2. Intent Persistence
Tracks user goals across multiple turns, even through topic changes.

### 3. Emotion and Tone Modeling
Adapts responses based on detected user emotion and conversation tone.

## Case Study: Customer Support Bot
